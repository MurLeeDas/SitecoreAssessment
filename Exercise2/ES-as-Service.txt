Running Elasticsearch as a Daemon Service on Linux:


Edit the bash profile that looks like this ~/.bash_profile to add the code below:

alias es=Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch() {
/usr/local/share/Elasticsearch/bin/service/Elasticsearch $1
}

After Elasticsearch and Oracleâ€™s JDK is installed ,the service will not start as a default setting. The configuration is located in the /etc/sysconfig/Elasticsearch directory. A user can run these commands in terminal to enable Elasticsearch to start after the server or system has booted:
sudo update-rc.d Elasticsearch defaults 95 10
sudo /etc/init.d/Elasticsearch start
